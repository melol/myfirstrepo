LEARNED 2 brand new things about Apache CXF.
1) download Apache CXF, navigate to lib and read file WHICH_JARS
2) There is one big cxf jar, that contains file META-INF/services/javax.xml.ws.spi.Provider
3) if you find the aforementionted class in javadoc, then you will find an algorithm whose purpose is to choose jax-ws implementation
